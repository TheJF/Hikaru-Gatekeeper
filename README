===============================

Script that checks in a Mongo database if the incoming card ID is associated to a member, and sends back a signal indicating whether access is granted or not.

==Setup==
To make it run, you first need to create a server.cfg that will exist in the same directory than the script. Inside the server.cfg file, you can put in this information, modified to your needs:
[Server]
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 9999

[Crypto]
salt: your_own_salt

[Mongo]
host: 127.0.0.1
port: 27017
database: your_own_db
